# ChatServer
This is an attempt to make something useful out of what I have learned in class.
My goal is a very simple chat server that will make use of my knowledge of Threads, IO, GUIs, etc.
I've decided to make this from scratch so that I will learn plenty from it.
This is a learning experience for me and so far it's going great.
